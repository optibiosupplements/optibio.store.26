## The Mission: 10,000 Bottles by January 31, 2026

### Revenue Mathematics

The path to 10,000 bottles requires precise execution across every funnel stage. With an average order value of $49.99 per bottle and a target conversion rate of 4-6%, OptiBio needs to drive approximately 250,000 qualified visitors to the site within the next 13 months.

**Revenue Breakdown:**
- Single bottle sales (40%): 4,000 bottles × $49.99 = $199,960
- 3-month bundles (35%): 3,500 bottles × $44.99/bottle = $157,465
- 6-month bundles (25%): 2,500 bottles × $41.66/bottle = $104,150
- **Total Revenue:** $461,575 (conservative) to $499,900 (target)

**Traffic Requirements:**
- Target conversion rate: 4% (conservative) to 6% (optimistic)
- Orders needed: 10,000 bottles / 1.5 avg bottles per order = 6,667 orders
- Visitors required: 6,667 / 4% = 166,675 (minimum) to 250,000 (target)
- Monthly visitors: 12,821 to 19,231
- Daily visitors: 427 to 641

**Customer Acquisition Economics:**
- Target CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): $25-35
- Marketing budget required: 6,667 orders × $30 CAC = $200,010
- Target LTV (Lifetime Value): $150-200 (3-4 repeat purchases)
- LTV:CAC ratio: 5:1 to 6:1 (healthy DTC metrics)
