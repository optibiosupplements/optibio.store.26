## 🔧 DIALOG CLOSE BUTTON FIX V3 (Real Issue Found)

- [x] Remove custom close button from EmailCaptureModal (lines 85-91)
- [x] Use DialogContent's built-in showCloseButton prop instead
- [x] Verify only one X button appears
- [ ] Test dialog appearance
- [ ] Save checkpoint

ROOT CAUSE: EmailCaptureModal has its own custom close button (lines 85-91) which creates a duplicate. DialogContent already has a built-in close button with showCloseButton prop.
