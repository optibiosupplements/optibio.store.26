# Implementation Status - Mockup F Optimized V2

## Current Observations (Jan 31, 2026)

### Hero Section Status
The hero section is implemented but the product image with golden glow appears to be positioned in a separate area below the main hero content. This is a layout issue that needs to be addressed.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Product image positioning** - The bottle image with glow appears below the hero content instead of alongside it on desktop
2. **Layout structure** - The two-column layout (content left, product right) is not displaying correctly
3. **Golden glow visibility** - The glow effect is present but may need to be more visible

### What's Working:
- ✅ Sticky header with mini CTA
- ✅ Working countdown timer
- ✅ Quantity bundle selector (1/3/6 bottles)
- ✅ Reviews badge (4.9 stars, 2,847 reviews)
- ✅ Trust badges (Clinically studied, 3rd-party tested, Non-GMO)
- ✅ Social proof card (12,000+ people)
- ✅ Price display with savings
- ✅ Pre-order CTA button

### Next Steps:
1. Fix the hero layout to show product image alongside content on desktop
2. Ensure the golden glow effect is visible behind the product
3. Test mobile responsiveness
4. Verify all CRO elements are properly positioned
