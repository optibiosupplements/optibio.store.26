## 1. Clinically Proven Stress Relief

Modern life is inherently stressful. Between work demands, family responsibilities, financial pressures, and constant digital connectivity, chronic stress has become a public health crisis. According to the American Psychological Association, 77% of Americans regularly experience physical symptoms caused by stress [1]. The good news? Ashwagandha offers one of the most well-documented natural solutions for stress management.

A landmark 2012 study published in the *Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine* examined the effects of high-concentration full-spectrum Ashwagandha root extract on stress and anxiety in adults. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 64 participants with a history of chronic stress. After 60 days of supplementation with 600mg of KSM-66 daily, participants experienced a remarkable 44% reduction in perceived stress scores compared to just 5.5% in the placebo group [2].

What makes this even more impressive is the biological mechanism behind these results. Ashwagandha works by modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the body's central stress response system. When you encounter a stressor, your HPA axis triggers the release of cortisol, often called the "stress hormone." While cortisol is essential for survival in acute situations, chronic elevation leads to a cascade of health problems including weight gain, insomnia, weakened immunity, and accelerated aging.

The same 2012 study measured serum cortisol levels and found that Ashwagandha supplementation reduced cortisol by an average of 27.9% [2]. This isn't just a subjective feeling of being less stressed—it's a measurable, biological change that protects your body from the damaging effects of chronic stress. Participants also reported significant improvements in energy levels, sleep quality, and overall sense of well-being.

For anyone dealing with work-related burnout, exam stress, caregiving responsibilities, or the general pressures of modern life, Ashwagandha offers a scientifically validated path to resilience. Unlike pharmaceutical interventions that often come with side effects and dependency risks, Ashwagandha helps your body adapt to stress naturally, building long-term resilience rather than simply masking symptoms.

## 2. Anxiety Management Without Sedation

While stress and anxiety are related, they're not identical. Stress is typically a response to external pressures, while anxiety is a more persistent state of worry and apprehension that can occur even without obvious triggers. Generalized anxiety disorder affects approximately 6.8 million American adults, yet only about 43% receive treatment [3]. Many people avoid pharmaceutical interventions due to concerns about side effects, dependency, or the sedating effects that interfere with daily functioning.

Ashwagandha offers a compelling alternative. A 2019 study published in *Medicine* investigated the stress-relieving and pharmacological actions of Ashwagandha extract in healthy adults experiencing stress. The eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involved 60 participants who received either 240mg of KSM-66 twice daily (480mg total) or placebo. The results were striking: participants in the Ashwagandha group experienced a 41% reduction in anxiety scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), compared to minimal change in the placebo group [4].

What sets Ashwagandha apart from both pharmaceutical anxiolytics and other herbal remedies is its unique mechanism of action. Rather than acting as a sedative, Ashwagandha works through GABA-ergic pathways, enhancing the function of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the brain. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, responsible for promoting calm and reducing neural excitability. By supporting GABA function, Ashwagandha promotes a state of calm alertness rather than drowsiness.

This distinction is crucial for people who need to manage anxiety while maintaining focus and productivity. Unlike benzodiazepines, which can cause sedation, cognitive impairment, and carry significant dependency risks, Ashwagandha provides anxiety relief without compromising mental clarity or daily functioning. The same 2019 study found that participants experienced improved sleep quality and reduced morning cortisol levels (31.5% reduction), along with a 28% decrease in C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation [4].

For individuals dealing with social anxiety, performance anxiety, or generalized anxiety disorder, Ashwagandha represents a safe, effective, and non-habit-forming option. The clinical evidence supports its use as either a standalone intervention for mild to moderate anxiety or as a complementary approach alongside therapy and other lifestyle modifications.

## 3. Enhanced Memory and Cognitive Function

In an age where cognitive performance is increasingly valued—whether you're a student preparing for exams, a professional managing complex projects, or an older adult concerned about age-related cognitive decline—maintaining sharp mental function is essential. Ashwagandha has demonstrated remarkable neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing properties in multiple clinical trials.

A 2017 study published in the *Journal of Dietary Supplements* examined the effects of Ashwagandha root extract on memory and cognitive function in adults with mild cognitive impairment. The eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 50 participants who received either 600mg of KSM-66 daily or placebo. The Ashwagandha group showed significant improvements in both immediate and general memory, as well as executive function, sustained attention, and information processing speed [5].

The cognitive benefits of Ashwagandha stem from several complementary mechanisms. First, it exhibits potent neuroprotective effects, shielding brain cells from oxidative stress and inflammation—two major contributors to cognitive decline. Research has shown that Ashwagandha's withanolides, the primary bioactive compounds, can reduce oxidative damage to neurons and support the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein essential for neuronal growth, survival, and plasticity [6].

Second, Ashwagandha modulates acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter critical for learning and memory. By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, Ashwagandha helps maintain higher levels of this important neurotransmitter in the brain. This mechanism is similar to how some pharmaceutical cognitive enhancers work, but without the side effects.

Third, by reducing cortisol and stress, Ashwagandha indirectly supports cognitive function. Chronic stress and elevated cortisol are known to impair memory formation, reduce hippocampal volume, and accelerate cognitive aging. By normalizing the stress response, Ashwagandha creates an optimal internal environment for cognitive performance.

Whether you're a student looking to enhance learning and retention, a professional seeking to maintain focus and mental clarity, or someone concerned about preserving cognitive function as you age, Ashwagandha offers scientifically validated cognitive support. The improvements typically become noticeable within four to eight weeks of consistent supplementation.

## 4. Improved Sleep Quality

Quality sleep is foundational to health, yet approximately 70 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems [7]. While many turn to pharmaceutical sleep aids, these often come with concerning side effects including next-day grogginess, dependency, and even increased mortality risk with long-term use. Ashwagandha offers a natural, non-habit-forming alternative that addresses sleep issues at their root cause.

A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis published in *PLOS ONE* examined the effects of Ashwagandha on sleep quality in adults. The analysis included five randomized controlled trials with a total of 400 participants. The researchers found that Ashwagandha supplementation significantly improved sleep quality, with particularly strong effects in adults diagnosed with insomnia. Participants taking Ashwagandha experienced a 72% improvement in sleep quality scores and reduced time to fall asleep by an average of 29% [8].

The sleep-promoting effects of Ashwagandha work through multiple pathways. As we've discussed, Ashwagandha significantly reduces cortisol levels. Since cortisol naturally follows a circadian rhythm—highest in the morning, lowest at night—chronically elevated evening cortisol is a common cause of insomnia. By normalizing cortisol patterns, Ashwagandha helps restore the body's natural sleep-wake cycle.

Additionally, Ashwagandha's GABA-ergic activity promotes relaxation and reduces the racing thoughts and anxiety that often prevent people from falling asleep. Unlike pharmaceutical sleep aids that force sedation, Ashwagandha supports the body's natural sleep mechanisms, leading to more restorative sleep architecture with proper cycling through all sleep stages.

Participants in clinical trials consistently report not just falling asleep faster, but also experiencing deeper, more refreshing sleep and waking feeling more energized. This is because Ashwagandha doesn't just knock you out—it addresses the underlying stress and anxiety that disrupt sleep, while supporting the physiological processes that govern healthy sleep-wake cycles.

For optimal sleep benefits, many people find taking Ashwagandha in the evening (about an hour before bed) to be most effective, though the adaptogenic properties mean it can be taken at any time of day. The sleep improvements typically become noticeable within one to two weeks, with continued enhancement over the first month of use.

## 5. Increased Muscle Strength and Recovery

For athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and anyone interested in building or maintaining muscle mass, Ashwagandha has emerged as one of the most well-researched natural performance enhancers. Unlike questionable supplements with minimal evidence, multiple rigorous clinical trials have demonstrated Ashwagandha's ability to significantly enhance strength, muscle mass, and recovery.

A groundbreaking 2015 study published in the *Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition* examined the effects of Ashwagandha supplementation on muscle strength and recovery in resistance-trained men. The eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 57 participants who engaged in resistance training while taking either 600mg of KSM-66 daily or placebo [9].

The results were impressive across multiple measures. Participants in the Ashwagandha group experienced significantly greater increases in muscle strength compared to placebo. Specifically, bench press strength improved by 15% more in the Ashwagandha group, while leg extension strength showed even greater gains. Perhaps most remarkably, participants taking Ashwagandha gained significantly more muscle mass (measured by arm and chest circumference) and experienced greater reductions in body fat percentage—an average decrease of 3.5% compared to 1.5% in the placebo group [9].

The mechanisms behind these performance benefits are multifaceted. First, Ashwagandha has been shown to support healthy testosterone levels in men. A 2019 study found that overweight men taking Ashwagandha experienced a 14.7% increase in testosterone levels compared to placebo [10]. Since testosterone plays a crucial role in muscle protein synthesis and recovery, this hormonal support translates directly into better training adaptations.

Second, Ashwagandha reduces exercise-induced muscle damage and accelerates recovery. The same 2015 study found that participants taking Ashwagandha had significantly lower levels of creatine kinase, a marker of muscle damage, after intense training sessions [9]. Faster recovery means you can train more frequently and intensely, leading to better long-term progress.

Third, by reducing cortisol—a catabolic hormone that breaks down muscle tissue—Ashwagandha creates a more anabolic internal environment. This is particularly important during calorie restriction or high-stress periods when muscle loss is a concern.

Whether you're a competitive athlete looking for a legal, natural performance edge, a recreational gym-goer trying to maximize your training results, or an older adult working to prevent age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia), Ashwagandha offers scientifically validated support for strength, muscle growth, and recovery.

## 6. Enhanced Endurance and Cardiorespiratory Fitness

While Ashwagandha's strength-building benefits are impressive, its effects on endurance and cardiovascular fitness are equally noteworthy. For runners, cyclists, swimmers, or anyone engaged in aerobic activities, Ashwagandha can significantly enhance performance and training capacity.

A 2015 study published in the *International Journal of Ayurveda Research* investigated the effects of Ashwagandha on cardiorespiratory endurance in healthy athletic adults. The eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial measured VO2 max (the maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilize during exercise—the gold standard measure of aerobic fitness) before and after supplementation with 600mg of KSM-66 daily [11].

The results showed that participants taking Ashwagandha experienced significant improvements in VO2 max compared to placebo, indicating enhanced cardiovascular efficiency and endurance capacity. Additionally, participants reported reduced perceived exertion during exercise, meaning they could work harder while feeling less fatigued [11].

These endurance benefits likely stem from several mechanisms. Ashwagandha has been shown to increase hemoglobin and red blood cell count, improving oxygen delivery to working muscles [12]. It also enhances mitochondrial function—the cellular powerhouses responsible for energy production—allowing for more efficient ATP generation during sustained activity.

Furthermore, Ashwagandha's stress-reducing properties play a role in endurance performance. Exercise itself is a form of physical stress, and chronic psychological stress can impair recovery and adaptation to training. By normalizing cortisol and supporting the body's stress response systems, Ashwagandha helps athletes adapt more effectively to training loads.

For endurance athletes, recreational runners, or anyone looking to improve cardiovascular fitness, Ashwagandha offers a natural, evidence-based way to enhance performance. The improvements typically become noticeable after four to eight weeks of consistent supplementation combined with regular training.

## 7. Support for Healthy Body Composition

One of the most frustrating aspects of chronic stress is its tendency to promote weight gain, particularly around the midsection. The relationship between stress, cortisol, and body fat—especially visceral fat—is well-established in scientific literature. Ashwagandha's ability to reduce stress and normalize cortisol makes it a valuable tool for supporting healthy body composition.

A 2017 study published in the *Journal of Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine* specifically examined Ashwagandha's effects on body weight management in adults under chronic stress. The eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 52 participants with chronic stress and a history of stress-related eating. Participants received either 600mg of KSM-66 daily or placebo [13].

The results demonstrated that Ashwagandha supplementation led to significant reductions in body weight, body mass index (BMI), and most importantly, serum cortisol levels. Participants in the Ashwagandha group also reported significant reductions in stress-related eating and food cravings. The study concluded that Ashwagandha root extract can be useful in weight management in adults under chronic stress [13].

The connection between cortisol and body fat, particularly abdominal fat, is well-documented. Elevated cortisol promotes fat storage, especially in the visceral area (around organs), which is the most metabolically dangerous type of fat. Cortisol also increases appetite and cravings for high-calorie, high-sugar foods—the classic "stress eating" phenomenon. By reducing cortisol levels by an average of 27.9%, Ashwagandha addresses one of the root causes of stress-related weight gain.

Additionally, as we discussed earlier, Ashwagandha supports muscle growth and strength. Since muscle tissue is metabolically active and burns more calories at rest than fat tissue, increasing muscle mass naturally supports a healthier body composition and metabolic rate.

It's important to note that Ashwagandha is not a magic weight-loss pill. Rather, it addresses one of the underlying factors—chronic stress and elevated cortisol—that make weight management difficult. When combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise, Ashwagandha can be a valuable component of a comprehensive approach to achieving and maintaining a healthy body composition.

## 8. Thyroid Function Support

The thyroid gland plays a crucial role in regulating metabolism, energy production, body temperature, and numerous other physiological processes. Subclinical hypothyroidism—a condition where thyroid hormone levels are slightly below normal but not low enough for a clinical diagnosis—affects millions of people and can cause fatigue, weight gain, depression, and cognitive difficulties.

A 2018 study published in the *Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine* investigated the efficacy and safety of Ashwagandha root extract in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. The eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 50 participants with elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, indicating underactive thyroid function. Participants received either 600mg of KSM-66 daily or placebo [14].

The results were remarkable. Participants taking Ashwagandha experienced significant improvements in thyroid hormone levels. Specifically, serum TSH levels decreased (indicating improved thyroid function), while free T3 and free T4 levels increased significantly compared to placebo. These changes brought thyroid hormone levels into the normal range for many participants, alleviating symptoms of hypothyroidism without the need for pharmaceutical intervention [14].

The mechanisms by which Ashwagandha supports thyroid function aren't fully understood, but research suggests it may work by reducing oxidative stress in the thyroid gland, supporting the conversion of T4 (the inactive thyroid hormone) to T3 (the active form), and potentially modulating the HPA axis, which interacts closely with thyroid function.

It's important to note that individuals with hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) should exercise caution with Ashwagandha and consult their healthcare provider, as it may further increase thyroid hormone levels. However, for the many people struggling with subclinical hypothyroidism or low thyroid function, Ashwagandha offers a natural, evidence-based approach to supporting optimal thyroid health.

As with any supplement affecting thyroid function, it's advisable to work with a healthcare provider and monitor thyroid hormone levels, especially if you're taking thyroid medications, as Ashwagandha may allow for dose reductions under medical supervision.

## 9. Blood Sugar Regulation

Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes have reached epidemic proportions, affecting over 100 million Americans [15]. While diet and exercise remain the cornerstones of blood sugar management, Ashwagandha has demonstrated promising effects on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in multiple studies.

A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis published in *Phytotherapy Research* examined the effects of Ashwagandha on glycemic control in humans. The analysis included multiple randomized controlled trials and found that Ashwagandha supplementation significantly reduced fasting blood glucose levels, hemoglobin A1c (a measure of long-term blood sugar control), and insulin levels, while improving insulin sensitivity [16].

The mechanisms behind these metabolic benefits are multifaceted. First, by reducing cortisol levels, Ashwagandha indirectly improves insulin sensitivity. Chronically elevated cortisol promotes insulin resistance and increases blood sugar levels—one reason why chronic stress is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Second, research suggests that Ashwagandha's bioactive compounds may enhance glucose uptake in cells and improve the function of pancreatic beta cells, which produce insulin.

Additionally, Ashwagandha's anti-inflammatory properties may play a role. Chronic low-grade inflammation is increasingly recognized as a key driver of insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. By reducing inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein, Ashwagandha may help restore more normal metabolic function.

For individuals with prediabetes, metabolic syndrome, or type 2 diabetes, Ashwagandha may serve as a valuable complementary intervention alongside diet, exercise, and medical treatment. However, because Ashwagandha can lower blood sugar levels, individuals taking diabetes medications should work closely with their healthcare provider and monitor blood glucose carefully, as medication adjustments may be necessary to prevent hypoglycemia.

## 10. Male Reproductive Health and Fertility

Infertility affects approximately 15% of couples worldwide, with male factors contributing to about half of all cases [17]. Stress, oxidative damage, and hormonal imbalances can all negatively impact sperm quality and male fertility. Ashwagandha has been traditionally used to support male reproductive health, and modern research has validated many of these traditional uses.

A 2010 study published in *Fertility and Sterility* examined the effects of Ashwagandha on semen quality in infertile men. The study involved 75 men experiencing fertility issues who were given Ashwagandha supplementation for three months. The results showed significant improvements in multiple parameters of sperm quality, including sperm concentration (increased by 167%), sperm motility (increased by 57%), and semen volume [18].

Even more impressively, the treatment resulted in pregnancy in the partners of 14% of the participants—a remarkable outcome for men who had been struggling with infertility. The study also found significant reductions in oxidative stress markers in semen, suggesting that Ashwagandha's antioxidant properties protect sperm from damage [18].

As mentioned earlier, Ashwagandha also supports healthy testosterone levels. A 2019 study found that overweight men aged 40-70 taking Ashwagandha experienced a 14.7% increase in testosterone levels, along with improvements in muscle strength and reductions in body fat [10]. Healthy testosterone levels are essential not just for fertility, but for overall male health, including muscle mass, bone density, mood, cognitive function, and cardiovascular health.

For men dealing with fertility challenges, low testosterone, or simply looking to optimize reproductive and overall health, Ashwagandha offers scientifically validated support. The improvements in sperm quality and testosterone typically become apparent after eight to twelve weeks of consistent supplementation.

## 11. Immune System Modulation

A well-functioning immune system is essential for protecting against infections, supporting recovery from illness, and maintaining overall health. Ashwagandha's classification as an adaptogen means it helps the body maintain homeostasis and resilience in the face of various stressors—and this includes supporting optimal immune function.

Research has demonstrated that Ashwagandha exhibits immunomodulatory properties, meaning it helps balance immune function rather than simply boosting or suppressing it. A 2011 study published in the *Journal of Ethnopharmacology* found that Ashwagandha extract significantly enhanced immune cell activity, including increased production of white blood cells and improved function of natural killer cells, which play a crucial role in fighting infections and cancer cells [19].

The relationship between stress and immune function is well-established. Chronic stress and elevated cortisol suppress immune function, making you more susceptible to infections and slower to recover from illness. By normalizing the stress response and reducing cortisol, Ashwagandha indirectly supports immune health.

Additionally, Ashwagandha exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties. While acute inflammation is a necessary part of the immune response, chronic low-grade inflammation contributes to numerous health problems, from cardiovascular disease to autoimmune conditions to accelerated aging. Multiple studies have shown that Ashwagandha significantly reduces inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), which decreased by 36% in one study [20].

It's worth noting that individuals with autoimmune conditions should consult their healthcare provider before taking Ashwagandha, as its immune-modulating effects could theoretically affect autoimmune disease activity. However, for most people, Ashwagandha's ability to support balanced immune function while reducing harmful chronic inflammation makes it a valuable component of a comprehensive wellness strategy.

## 12. Antioxidant and Anti-Aging Properties

Perhaps one of the most exciting areas of Ashwagandha research relates to its potential anti-aging and longevity-promoting effects. While we can't stop the aging process entirely, we can influence how we age—and emerging research suggests Ashwagandha may help support healthy aging at the cellular level.

Oxidative stress—damage caused by unstable molecules called free radicals—is one of the primary drivers of aging and age-related diseases. Our bodies naturally produce antioxidants to neutralize free radicals, but this protective system becomes less efficient with age, and chronic stress accelerates oxidative damage. Ashwagandha is a potent antioxidant, with research demonstrating its ability to increase levels of key antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase [21].

A 2023 comprehensive review published in *Nutrients* examined the current research on Ashwagandha's health-promoting activities. The authors highlighted Ashwagandha's neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties, noting its potential role in supporting healthy aging and reducing the risk of age-related diseases [22].

Beyond direct antioxidant effects, Ashwagandha influences several pathways associated with longevity. By reducing chronic stress and normalizing cortisol, Ashwagandha protects against stress-accelerated aging. Chronic stress literally ages you faster at the cellular level, shortening telomeres (the protective caps on chromosomes that shorten with age) and promoting cellular senescence. By supporting a healthy stress response, Ashwagandha may help slow these aging processes.

Additionally, Ashwagandha's ability to support mitochondrial function, reduce inflammation, protect against oxidative damage, and support cognitive function all contribute to healthier aging. While more research is needed to fully understand Ashwagandha's longevity-promoting potential, the existing evidence suggests it may be a valuable tool for supporting not just lifespan, but healthspan—the number of years we live in good health.

## Why KSM-66 Specifically?

Throughout this article, we've specifically referenced KSM-66 Ashwagandha. This isn't arbitrary—there are important differences between KSM-66 and generic ashwagandha supplements that directly impact effectiveness and safety.

KSM-66 is a full-spectrum root extract, meaning it contains the complete range of bioactive compounds found in the ashwagandha root in their natural ratios. This is significant because many cheaper supplements use leaf extracts or root-and-leaf combinations, which have different chemical profiles and haven't been studied as extensively. The clinical research demonstrating the benefits we've discussed used specifically KSM-66 root extract.

KSM-66 is standardized to contain at least 5% withanolides, the primary bioactive compounds responsible for Ashwagandha's effects. Generic supplements often don't specify withanolide content, or contain lower concentrations, meaning you'd need to take much higher doses to achieve equivalent effects—if they work at all.

Perhaps most importantly, KSM-66 has been the subject of over 20 published clinical trials, making it the most extensively researched ashwagandha extract available. When you choose KSM-66, you're choosing an extract with proven efficacy, established safety, and consistent quality. The 600mg daily dose used in most studies—and provided in OptiBio's formulation—has been validated across multiple research settings and populations.

KSM-66 is also produced using a proprietary "Green Chemistry" extraction process that doesn't use alcohol or chemical solvents, preserving the full spectrum of bioactive compounds while ensuring purity. Every batch undergoes rigorous third-party testing for heavy metals, microbial contamination, and potency, providing assurance that what's on the label matches what's in the bottle.

## How to Take Ashwagandha for Maximum Benefits

Based on the clinical research, here are evidence-based guidelines for taking Ashwagandha:

**Dosage:** The clinically validated dose is 600mg of KSM-66 extract daily. Some studies use split dosing (300mg twice daily), while others use a single 600mg dose. Both approaches have been shown to be effective, so choose based on your preference and lifestyle.

**Timing:** Ashwagandha can be taken at any time of day, with or without food. For stress and anxiety management, many people prefer taking it in the morning or splitting the dose between morning and evening. For sleep support, taking the full dose in the evening (about an hour before bed) may be most beneficial.

**Timeline:** While some people notice subtle effects within the first week (particularly improved sleep), most of the significant benefits emerge over 2-4 weeks of consistent use. Stress and anxiety relief typically becomes noticeable within 3-4 weeks, while physical performance benefits may take 8-12 weeks to fully manifest. Consistency is key—daily supplementation produces better results than sporadic use.

**Safety:** Ashwagandha has an excellent safety profile, with clinical trials reporting adverse events in less than 5% of participants, most commonly mild digestive upset that resolves quickly. However, pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid Ashwagandha. Individuals with autoimmune conditions or thyroid disorders should consult their healthcare provider before use. If you're taking medications for anxiety, thyroid function, blood pressure, or blood sugar, discuss Ashwagandha with your doctor, as it may enhance these medications' effects, potentially requiring dose adjustments.
