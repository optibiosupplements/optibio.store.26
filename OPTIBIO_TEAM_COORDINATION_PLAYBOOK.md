- Watch session recordings (what's confusing?)
- Identify bottleneck (product page? cart? checkout?)

**Day 2 (Tuesday):** Designer + Content Strategist brainstorm

- Prioritize based on impact potential and effort

**Day 3 (Wednesday):** Content Strategist writes new copy
- Write new headlines, bullet points, CTAs
- Test different angles (benefits vs. features, urgency vs. social proof)

- Set up A/B test (50/50 traffic split)
- Configure conversion tracking
- Launch test by EOD

**Day 5-18 (2 weeks):** Monitor test performance
- Designer checks daily (is test running correctly?)
- Performance Marketing monitors traffic (enough visitors for significance?)
- Fractional CFO validates impact (is lift worth the effort?)

**Day 19 (Friday):** Team reviews results
- Designer shares results (conversion rate lift, statistical significance)
- If winner: Implement permanently
- If loser: Document learnings, design next test

**Outcome:** Continuous conversion rate improvement

---

### Workflow 3: Customer Issue Escalation

**Trigger:** Customer Success encounters issue requiring team input

**Process:**

**Immediate (within 1 hour):** Customer Success triages
- Assess severity (minor inconvenience? safety concern? legal threat?)
- Determine if within authority (can I solve this myself?)
- If yes: Solve immediately, document in weekly report
- If no: Escalate to appropriate team member or founder

**Escalation Paths:**

**Product quality issue** → Escalate to Founder
- Example: Customer reports adverse reaction, contamination, or safety concern
- Action: Founder coordinates with manufacturer, decides on recall/refund

**Shipping/fulfillment issue** → Customer Success resolves
- Example: Lost package, wrong address, damaged in transit
- Action: Send replacement immediately, file claim with 3PL

**Website/technical issue** → Escalate to Designer or Performance Marketing
- Example: Checkout broken, page not loading, mobile issue
- Action: Designer fixes immediately, tests across devices

**Pricing/refund issue** → Escalate to Fractional CFO
- Example: Customer disputes charge, requests bulk discount
- Action: CFO advises on pricing policy, approves exceptions

**Marketing/messaging issue** → Escalate to Content Strategist
- Example: Customer confused by ad claim, wants scientific proof
- Action: Content Strategist provides clinical studies, updates copy if needed

**Follow-up (within 24 hours):** Customer Success closes loop
- Update customer with resolution
- Document issue in weekly report
- Share learnings with team (how do we prevent this?)

**Outcome:** Fast resolution, continuous improvement

4. Founder schedules call if needed
5. Founder approves, rejects, or requests more info
6. Person implements decision

---

## Conflict Resolution

### Step 1: Direct Communication

If two team members disagree, they should talk directly first (Slack DM or call).

**Example:**
- Performance Marketing wants to spend $5K on TikTok
- Fractional CFO thinks it's too risky (unproven channel)
- They discuss: What's the hypothesis? What's the downside? What's the test plan?

---

### Step 2: Data-Driven Discussion

If direct communication doesn't resolve, bring data to the discussion.

**Example:**
- Performance Marketing shares: TikTok CPMs are 50% lower than Facebook
- Fractional CFO shares: But TikTok conversion rate is unknown, could be 2x worse
- Both agree: Test with $1K first, measure conversion rate, then decide

---

### Step 3: Founder Tie-Breaker

If data doesn't resolve, escalate to founder for final decision.

**Example:**
- Performance Marketing and Fractional CFO still disagree on TikTok
- Founder decides: Test with $1K, but only if Facebook CAC >$40 (need alternative channel)

---

---

## Team Culture & Values

### 1. Bias Toward Action

**What it means:** When in doubt, do something. Learn by doing, not by planning.

**In practice:**
- Launch imperfect ads and iterate (don't wait for perfect creative)
- Test pricing changes (don't debate for weeks)
- Ship A/B tests (don't overthink hypothesis)

**Red flag:** Analysis paralysis, endless meetings, "let's think about it"

---

### 2. Data-Driven Decisions

**What it means:** Use metrics to guide decisions, not gut feelings or opinions.

**In practice:**
- Review A/B test results before declaring winner
- Track CAC, LTV, conversion rate daily
- Use cohort analysis to evaluate channel performance

**Red flag:** "I think this will work" without data, ignoring test results

---

### 3. Customer Obsession

**What it means:** Every decision should improve customer experience.

**In practice:**
- Respond to support tickets within 2 hours
- Collect testimonials and reviews regularly
- Use customer language in marketing copy

**Red flag:** Ignoring customer feedback, slow response times, defensive about complaints

---

### 4. Radical Transparency

**What it means:** Share information openly, admit mistakes, ask for help.

**In practice:**
- Post daily standups (even if you had a bad day)
- Share failures in weekly reports (what didn't work)
- Ask for help when stuck (don't suffer in silence)

**Red flag:** Hiding problems, blaming others, pretending everything is fine

---

### 5. Continuous Improvement

**What it means:** Always be learning, testing, and optimizing.

**In practice:**
- Run 2-3 A/B tests at all times
- Document learnings (what did we learn this week?)
- Share knowledge with team (teach each other)

**Red flag:** "This is how we've always done it", no testing, no learning

---
