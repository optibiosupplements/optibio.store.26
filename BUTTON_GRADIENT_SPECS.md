# Button Gradient Specifications

Based on the ORIGINAL DESIGN CONCEPT.pdf, I can see the product label design but I need to locate the specific button gradient specifications that create the "glowing" effect you mentioned.

The pink and green buttons appear to have:
- A gradient overlay that creates a luminous/glowing effect
- Possibly a radial gradient or multi-stop linear gradient
- Enhanced visual depth beyond simple flat colors

Please provide the specific gradient values or point me to where these button specifications are documented so I can apply them accurately to the CTA buttons.
