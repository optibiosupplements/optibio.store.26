**Subject Line:** Welcome to OptiBio - Here's 46% Off 🎁  
**Preview Text:** Your first order ships Jan 20-27. Pre-order now and save.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Welcome to the OptiBio family.

You're here because you're tired of feeling stressed, exhausted, and overwhelmed. You've tried everything—more sleep, less coffee, meditation apps—and nothing's working.

We get it. That's why we created OptiBio.

**What makes us different?**

✅ **KSM-66® - The Gold Standard**  
Most ashwagandha brands use cheap extracts with fillers. We use KSM-66®—the most clinically-studied ashwagandha on the market. 20+ peer-reviewed studies. Real results.

✅ **Third-Party Tested**  
Every batch is tested for purity and potency. No heavy metals. No contaminants. Just clean, effective ashwagandha.

✅ **Transparent & Honest**  
We don't make fake claims. We show you the science. We stand behind our 90-day money-back guarantee.

**Here's what you can expect:**

- **Week 1-2:** Your body adjusts. You might not notice much yet. (This is normal for adaptogens.)
- **Week 2-3:** You start sleeping better. Stress feels more manageable. Energy improves.
- **Week 4+:** You feel like yourself again. Calm. Focused. Rested.

**Ready to start?**

Our next batch ships Jan 20-27. Pre-order now and save 46% ($37.49, was $69.99).

[Pre-Order Now - Save 46%]

Pre-orders close Jan 20. After that? Full price ($69.99) + 6-8 week wait.

### Email 2: The Science (Sent Day 2 after signup)

**Subject Line:** Why KSM-66® Works (And Other Brands Don't)  
**Preview Text:** 20+ clinical studies. Here's what the research says.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

Yesterday we told you about OptiBio. Today, let's talk about the science.

**Why does ashwagandha work?**

Ashwagandha is an adaptogen—a plant that helps your body adapt to stress. It works by regulating cortisol (your stress hormone) and supporting your nervous system.

But here's the catch: **Not all ashwagandha is created equal.**

Most brands use cheap extracts made from leaves and stems. These have low concentrations of withanolides (the active compounds) and often include fillers.

**OptiBio uses KSM-66®—the gold standard.**

✅ **Root-only extract** (no leaves, no stems, no fillers)  
✅ **Full-spectrum formula** (preserves all bioactive compounds)  
✅ **Standardized to 5% withanolides** (consistent potency every time)  
✅ **20+ clinical studies** (proven efficacy)

**What does the research say?**

📊 **44% reduction in stress markers** (cortisol, anxiety scales)  
📊 **72% improvement in sleep quality** (fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer)  
📊 **27.9% boost in physical performance** (strength, endurance, recovery)  
📊 **Significant improvement in focus and cognitive function**

These aren't marketing claims. These are peer-reviewed studies published in medical journals.

**Want to experience it yourself?**

Pre-order now: 46% off ($37.49, was $69.99). Ships Jan 20-27.

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: What's stopping you?

**Is it the price?**

**Is it the wait?**  
Next batch ships Jan 20-27. That's only 3-4 weeks. If you wait, you'll pay full price ($69.99) AND wait 6-8 weeks for the following batch.

**Is it skepticism?**  
We get it. You've tried other supplements that didn't work. But OptiBio is different:

- **KSM-66®** - Most clinically-studied ashwagandha (20+ studies)
- **Third-party tested** - Every batch verified for purity
- **90-day guarantee** - If it doesn't work, we refund you. No questions asked.
