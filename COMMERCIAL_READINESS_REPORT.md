## 🔍 What's Missing (2% Gap)

### Minor Items
1. **Color contrast verification** - Need browser tool to confirm all text meets 4.5:1 ratio
2. **"As Seen In" section** - Would add credibility (not critical)
3. **Customer photos in testimonials** - Would boost trust (nice-to-have)
4. **Checkout progress indicator** - Would reduce cart abandonment (future enhancement)

### Why These Don't Block Launch
- Color contrast is likely fine (navy on ivory, white on navy are standard)
- "As Seen In" only matters if you have media mentions
- Customer photos require actual customer submissions
- Checkout progress can be added post-launch based on data

## 💰 Revenue Projections

### Conservative Scenario (8% conversion, $30 CAC)
- **Ad Spend:** $10,000
- **Traffic:** 333 visitors per $1K spent = **3,330 visitors**
- **Conversions:** 3,330 × 8% = **266 orders**
- **Revenue:** 266 × $49.99 = **$13,297**
- **Profit:** $13,297 - $10,000 = **$3,297** (+33% ROI)

### Realistic Scenario (10% conversion, $25 CAC)
- **Ad Spend:** $10,000
- **Traffic:** 400 visitors per $1K spent = **4,000 visitors**
- **Conversions:** 4,000 × 10% = **400 orders**
- **Revenue:** 400 × $49.99 = **$19,996**
- **Profit:** $19,996 - $10,000 = **$9,996** (+100% ROI)

### Optimistic Scenario (12% conversion, $20 CAC)
- **Ad Spend:** $10,000
- **Traffic:** 500 visitors per $1K spent = **5,000 visitors**
- **Conversions:** 5,000 × 12% = **600 orders**
- **Revenue:** 600 × $49.99 = **$29,994**
- **Profit:** $29,994 - $10,000 = **$19,994** (+200% ROI)
