## COMMON SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Pre-Order Shipping Question

**Customer:** "When will my order ship? I ordered 2 weeks ago."

**Your Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out! Your order is on track to ship between January 20-27 (we're in the final week of preparation).

Here's what's happening:
- Week of Jan 15: Final quality testing and packaging
- Jan 20-27: Your bottle ships with tracking number
- 3-5 business days: Delivery to your door

You'll get an email with tracking info the moment it ships.

In the meantime, have you downloaded your bonus Stress Management Guide? It's a great way to start your wellness journey while you wait.

Thanks for your patience!  
[Your Name]  
Customer Success, OptiBio
```

---

### Scenario 2: Ingredient Question

**Customer:** "Is this safe to take with my SSRI medication?"

**Your Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

Great question - I'm glad you're being careful about interactions.

Ashwagandha (KSM-66) is generally well-tolerated, but it can interact with certain medications, including SSRIs. While many people take them together without issues, I always recommend checking with your doctor or pharmacist first.

Here's what we know:
- Ashwagandha may enhance the effects of SSRIs (which could be good or require dose adjustment)
- Clinical studies show KSM-66 is safe for most people, but individual responses vary
- Your doctor knows your specific medication and health history

Would you like me to send you the clinical study data to share with your doctor? Happy to provide that.

Safety first!  
[Your Name]  
Customer Success, OptiBio
```

---

### Scenario 3: Refund Request

**Customer:** "This didn't work for me. I want a refund."

**Your Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm sorry to hear OptiBio didn't work for you. We stand behind our 90-day money-back guarantee, so I'll process your refund right away.

Quick question to help us improve: How long did you take it, and what were you hoping to experience?

(No pressure to answer - your refund is already approved either way. I'm just curious to learn.)

Your refund will be processed within 24 hours and should appear in your account in 3-5 business days.

Thanks for giving OptiBio a try!  
[Your Name]  
Customer Success, OptiBio
```

---

### Scenario 4: Collecting Testimonial

**Customer:** "I've been taking this for 3 weeks and I'm sleeping so much better!"

**Your Response:**
```
Hi [Name],

That's amazing to hear! Better sleep is life-changing.

Would you be willing to share your experience with others? We're collecting customer stories to help people understand what OptiBio can do.

If you're open to it, could you answer these quick questions?
1. What was your biggest challenge before OptiBio?
2. How long before you noticed results?

And if you'd be willing to share a photo (totally optional!), we'd love to feature you on our website or social media.

**Email 1: Welcome + Lead Magnet Delivery (Immediate)**

Subject: "Welcome to OptiBio! Here's your free guide 📖"

```
Hi [Name],

Welcome to the OptiBio community!

As promised, here's your Stress Management Guide (PDF attached).

Inside, you'll discover:
- 7 science-backed techniques to reduce stress in 5 minutes
- The optimal daily routine for calm and focus
- How adaptogens like ashwagandha work in your body

While you're reading, I wanted to introduce myself. I'm [Founder Name], and I started OptiBio because I was burned out, anxious, and exhausted. Traditional solutions didn't work. Then I discovered KSM-66 Ashwagandha.

It changed my life. And I want to share it with you.

Our first batch sold out in 72 hours. The next batch ships January 20.

Want to reserve yours?

**Email 2: The Science Behind OptiBio (Day 2)**

Subject: "Why KSM-66 is different (and why it matters)"

```
Hi [Name],

Yesterday I mentioned KSM-66 Ashwagandha. Today, let me explain why it's different.

Most ashwagandha supplements are cheap extracts with inconsistent potency. You're basically gambling on whether they'll work.

KSM-66 is different:
✓ Clinically studied in 24+ human trials
✓ 5% withanolides (the active compound)
✓ Full-spectrum root extract (not just isolated compounds)
✓ Third-party tested for purity and potency

The results? In clinical studies:
- 44% reduction in stress (measured by cortisol)
- 72% improvement in sleep quality
- 27.9% increase in energy levels

This isn't marketing hype. This is peer-reviewed science.

That's why we only use KSM-66. And why our customers see real results.

Ready to experience it yourself?

Subject: "1,247 people have pre-ordered. Here's why."

```
Hi [Name],

Since we opened pre-orders 4 days ago, 1,247 people have reserved their bottles.

Here's what they're saying:

"I've tried 5 different ashwagandha brands. OptiBio is the only one that actually worked." - Sarah M., NYC

"I was skeptical, but after 3 weeks I'm sleeping through the night for the first time in years." - Michael T., Austin

"The transparency is what sold me. I know exactly what I'm getting." - Jennifer L., SF

Our next batch ships January 20. Only 5,000 bottles available.

If you've been on the fence, now's the time.

## BUDGET ALLOCATION

| Platform | Budget | % | Daily Spend | Expected Orders | CPA Target |
|----------|--------|---|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Facebook/Instagram | $6,000 | 60% | $200 | 200-300 | $20-30 |
| Google Search | $2,000 | 20% | $67 | 50-67 | $30-40 |

---

## OPTIMIZATION RULES

**Pause ads if:**
- CPA >$50 after 50 clicks (not profitable)
- CTR <0.5% after 1,000 impressions (not engaging)
- Zero conversions after $100 spend (not converting)

**Scale ads if:**
- CPA <$30 after 10 conversions (highly profitable)
- CTR >2% after 1,000 impressions (highly engaging)
- ROAS >3x after $200 spend (strong ROI)

**Scaling Strategy:**
- Increase budget by 20% every 3 days (if performance holds)
- Duplicate winning ads to new audiences (expand reach)
- Create variations of winning creative (test similar angles)

## ANALYSIS FRAMEWORKS

### Framework 1: Funnel Optimization

**Steps:**
1. Map the funnel (awareness → consideration → purchase)
2. Calculate conversion rates at each stage
3. Identify biggest drop-off (where are we losing most people?)
4. Hypothesize reasons (why are they dropping off?)
5. Recommend tests (what can we change to improve?)

**Example:**

Funnel:
- Visitors: 1,000 (100%)
- Product page: 600 (60%)
- Add to cart: 150 (15% of visitors, 25% of product page viewers)
- Checkout: 100 (10% of visitors, 67% of carts)
- Purchase: 40 (4% of visitors, 40% of checkouts)

Insight: Biggest drop-off is product page → add to cart (only 25% add to cart). This suggests product page isn't compelling enough.

Recommendation: Test new product page headline, add more social proof, enhance urgency indicators.

---

### Framework 2: Marketing Attribution

**Steps:**
1. Track all touchpoints (ad click, email open, website visit)
2. Assign credit to touchpoints (first-click, last-click, or multi-touch)
3. Calculate CAC by channel
4. Calculate ROAS by channel
5. Recommend budget reallocation (shift spend to best-performing channels)

**Example:**

Attribution (last-click):
- Facebook: 150 orders, $3,000 spend, CAC = $20, ROAS = 2.5x
- Google: 50 orders, $1,000 spend, CAC = $20, ROAS = 2.5x
- TikTok: 25 orders, $500 spend, CAC = $20, ROAS = 2.5x
- Email: 25 orders, $0 spend, CAC = $0, ROAS = ∞

Insight: All paid channels have similar CAC and ROAS. Email is free and highly effective.

Recommendation: Maintain current paid spend allocation. Invest more in email list growth (lead magnets, popups).

---

### Framework 3: A/B Test Design

**Steps:**
1. Define hypothesis (what do we think will improve the metric?)
2. Choose metric (what are we trying to improve?)
3. Calculate sample size (how many visitors do we need?)
4. Set duration (how long should the test run?)
5. Monitor performance (is there a clear winner?)
6. Calculate significance (is the result statistically significant?)
7. Implement winner (roll out winning variation)

**Example:**

Hypothesis: Adding "Only 5,000 bottles left" urgency message will increase conversion rate.

Metric: Conversion rate (current: 4%)

Sample size: 2,000 visitors per variation (4,000 total) to detect 20% lift with 80% power

Duration: 5-7 days (based on traffic)

Result: Control: 4.0% conversion (80 orders / 2,000 visitors), Variation: 4.8% conversion (96 orders / 2,000 visitors)

Significance: p-value = 0.03 (statistically significant)

Recommendation: Implement urgency message site-wide. Expected lift: +20% conversions.
