# Hero Layout Status

## Current State
The hero section now shows the product image on the right side on desktop! The two-column layout is working.

## Issues to Fix
1. **Golden glow effect not visible** - The amber glow behind the product is not showing up
2. **Product image needs the glow effect** - Need to ensure the radial gradient and bokeh particles are visible

## Next Steps
1. Enhance the golden glow effect visibility
2. Ensure proper z-indexing for glow layers
3. Test mobile responsiveness
