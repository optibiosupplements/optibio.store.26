- What I'm designing today
- Any blockers (need copy? product photos? feedback?)

**Weekly Report (Friday by 5pm):**
- Designs delivered this week (ad creative, landing pages, emails)
- A/B test results (what won? what lost? what's next?)
- Conversion rate trends (are we improving?)
- Next week's priorities (what tests should we run?)

**Monthly Review (First Monday of month):**
- Portfolio of winning designs (what worked best?)

**When using AI:**

### Why This Role is Critical

You can't manage what you don't measure. This role ensures you understand your unit economics (CAC, LTV, contribution margin), maintain healthy cash flow, and prepare for fundraising if needed. Many DTC brands fail not because they can't acquire customers, but because they run out of cash.

- Build and maintain financial model (revenue, costs, cash flow, runway)
- Track unit economics (CAC, LTV, contribution margin, payback period)
- Forecast monthly performance (revenue, expenses, cash flow)
- Scenario planning (what if CAC increases? what if conversion rate improves?)
- Fundraising prep (cap table, financial projections, investor materials)

**Metrics Tracking (30% of time):**
- Calculate and track DTC metrics (CAC, LTV, LTV:CAC ratio, contribution margin)
- Monitor cash flow (burn rate, runway, working capital needs)
- Analyze cohort performance (which acquisition channels have best LTV?)
- Track inventory turns (how fast are we selling through stock?)
- Benchmark against industry standards (how do we compare?)

**Strategic Advising (20% of time):**
- Advise on pricing strategy (should we raise prices? offer bundles?)
- Recommend budget allocation (where should we spend more? less?)
- Evaluate partnership opportunities (co-packing, influencer deals, retail)
- Assess fundraising readiness (do we need capital? when? how much?)
- Risk management (what could go wrong? how do we mitigate?)

**Compliance & Admin (10% of time):**
- Bookkeeping oversight (ensure QuickBooks is up to date)
- Tax planning (quarterly estimates, deductions, sales tax)
- Payroll management (if hiring employees)

### Red Flags to Avoid

- ❌ Can't explain DTC metrics in simple terms
- ❌ No experience with early-stage companies (need to handle chaos)
- ❌ Overly conservative (need to balance risk and growth)
- ❌ Can't connect numbers to strategy (need business partner, not just accountant)

**When using AI:**
- ❌ No access to financial data (can't model without numbers)
- ❌ No strategic thinking (need human judgment for big decisions)
- ❌ No fundraising experience (investor relations require human touch)
