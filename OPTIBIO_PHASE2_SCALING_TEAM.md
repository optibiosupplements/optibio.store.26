**Purpose:** Complete agent profiles for OptiBio's Phase 2 scaling team (Month 6-12)

---

## Phase 2 Team Overview

After proving product-market fit with the Phase 1 launch team (5 people), it's time to scale. These 4 roles focus on retention, organic growth, product expansion, and data-driven optimization.

**When to hire Phase 2 team:**
- Revenue: $100K+ per month consistently
- Pre-orders: Successfully delivered 250-500+ units
- Unit economics: CAC <$40, LTV:CAC >3:1, contribution margin >60%
- Cash flow: 6+ months runway or fundraising secured
- Team capacity: Phase 1 team is overwhelmed, bottlenecks identified

**Phase 2 Team Structure:**
1. **Retention Marketing Manager** - Drives repeat purchases and LTV growth
2. **Influencer / Partnerships Manager** - Builds organic acquisition channels
3. **Product Development Specialist** - Expands product line beyond Ashwagandha
4. **Data Analyst** - Optimizes decisions with advanced analytics

**Total Team Size After Phase 2:** 9 people (5 from Phase 1 + 4 from Phase 2)

**Monthly Budget After Phase 2:** $50-75K (salaries + ad spend)

## Agent 6: Retention Marketing Manager

**Role Type:** Full-time (Human or AI-assisted)  
**Compensation:** $70-90K + equity (if human)  
**Critical Success Factor:** Once CAC is proven, retention drives profitability

### Why This Role is Critical

Acquiring a customer costs $20-40. Retaining that customer for a second purchase costs nearly zero. A 5% increase in retention can increase profits by 25-95%. This role owns the entire post-purchase experience: email, SMS, subscriptions, loyalty programs, and lifecycle marketing.

**Key insight:** If LTV increases from $100 to $150 (one additional purchase), your LTV:CAC ratio improves from 2.5:1 to 3.75:1—making every marketing dollar 50% more profitable.

### Core Responsibilities

**Email & SMS Marketing (40% of time):**
- Build and optimize email sequences (welcome, education, replenishment, winback)
- Launch SMS campaigns (order updates, promotions, exclusive offers)
- Segment customers by behavior (first-time buyers, repeat buyers, at-risk, VIP)
- A/B test subject lines, send times, content, offers
- Grow email/SMS lists (popups, lead magnets, giveaways)

**Subscription Program (30% of time):**
- Design subscription offering (save 15%, free shipping, cancel anytime)
- Optimize subscription flow (checkout, onboarding, management)
- Reduce churn (identify at-risk subscribers, send retention offers)
- Increase subscription adoption (convert one-time buyers to subscribers)
- Track subscription metrics (churn rate, LTV, retention rate)

**Loyalty Program (20% of time):**
- Design loyalty program (points for purchases, referrals, reviews)
- Implement rewards (discounts, free products, exclusive access)
- Promote loyalty program (email, SMS, website, checkout)
- Track engagement (points earned, rewards redeemed, program ROI)
- Optimize for retention (which rewards drive repeat purchases?)

**Lifecycle Marketing (10% of time):**
- Map customer journey (awareness → purchase → repeat → advocate)
- Identify drop-off points (where are customers churning?)
- Design interventions (winback campaigns, reactivation offers)
- Analyze cohort retention (30-day, 60-day, 90-day retention rates)
- Forecast LTV based on retention curves

### Skills Required

**Must-have:**
- Klaviyo or similar email/SMS platform (expert level)
- Lifecycle marketing (understand customer journey and retention psychology)
- Cohort analysis (track retention by acquisition source, product, time period)
- A/B testing (test everything: subject lines, content, timing, offers)
- Subscription mechanics (billing, churn reduction, reactivation)

**Nice-to-have:**
- Recharge or Bold (subscription platform integration)
- Loyalty Lion or Smile.io (loyalty program platforms)
- SQL (query customer data for segmentation)
- Copywriting (write compelling email/SMS content)
- Design basics (create email templates in Canva or Figma)

## Agent 7: Influencer / Partnerships Manager

**Role Type:** Full-time (Human recommended)  
**Compensation:** $60-80K + performance bonus (if human)  
**Critical Success Factor:** Paid ads get expensive; need organic channels

### Why This Role is Critical

As you scale paid ads, CAC increases (audience fatigue, competition, platform costs). Organic channels—influencers, podcasts, affiliates—provide lower CAC and higher trust. A single micro-influencer post can drive 50-100 sales at $5-10 CAC (vs. $30-40 for paid ads). This role builds and manages these relationships.

**Key insight:** Customers acquired through influencers have 20-30% higher LTV than paid ad customers (higher trust, better brand affinity).

### Core Responsibilities

- Relationship building (turn one-time posts into ongoing partnerships)

**Podcast Sponsorships (30% of time):**

- Track performance (promo codes, unique URLs, conversion rates)
- Optimize spend (double down on winners, cut losers)

**Affiliate Program (20% of time):**
- Build affiliate program (commission structure, terms, onboarding)
- Recruit affiliates (bloggers, YouTubers, newsletter writers)
- Provide assets (product info, images, copy, discount codes)
- Track performance (sales, commissions, top performers)
- Optimize program (increase commissions for top performers, cut inactive affiliates)

**Strategic Partnerships (10% of time):**
- Identify partnership opportunities (gyms, wellness centers, corporate wellness)
- Negotiate deals (wholesale, co-marketing, bulk orders)
- Manage relationships (regular check-ins, performance reviews)
- Track ROI (revenue, CAC, brand awareness)

### Skills Required

**Must-have:**
- Relationship building (authentic, long-term partnerships, not transactional)
- Negotiation (get best deals while maintaining good relationships)
- ROI tracking (calculate CAC, ROAS, LTV by channel)
- Content evaluation (know what makes a good influencer post or podcast ad)
- Project management (manage 10-20 partnerships simultaneously)

**Nice-to-have:**
- Influencer marketing platforms (Aspire, Grin, CreatorIQ)
- Affiliate platforms (Impact, Refersion, PartnerStack)
- Social media expertise (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube)
- Copywriting (write influencer briefs, podcast scripts)
- Basic analytics (Google Analytics, UTM tracking)

### Success Metrics (KPIs)

**Primary Metrics:**

### Decision-Making Authority

**You can decide without approval:**
- Gifting products to influencers (<$500 value per month)
- Micro-influencer deals (<$500 per post)

- Outreach and negotiation tactics
- Content briefs and guidelines

**You must get approval for:**
- Macro-influencer deals (>$1K per post)

### Red Flags to Avoid

**When hiring a human:**

- ❌ No ROI tracking (must calculate CAC, ROAS, LTV by partner)
- ❌ Can't negotiate (need to get good deals without burning bridges)
- ❌ No content judgment (need to know what makes good influencer content)
- ❌ Disorganized (managing 20+ partnerships requires systems)

**When using AI:**
- ❌ Can't build relationships (influencers want human connection)

## Agent 8: Product Development Specialist

**Role Type:** Contract → Full-time (Human required)  
**Compensation:** $70-90K + equity (if full-time)  
**Critical Success Factor:** Can't be a one-product company forever

### Why This Role is Critical

Relying on a single product (Ashwagandha) is risky. Customer churn increases, acquisition costs rise, and competitors catch up. Product expansion—new SKUs, bundles, line extensions—increases LTV, reduces churn, and opens new customer segments. This role owns the entire product pipeline from ideation to launch.

**Key insight:** Customers who buy 2+ products have 3-5x higher LTV than single-product buyers.

### Core Responsibilities

**Product Ideation (30% of time):**

- Regulatory compliance (FDA structure/function claims, labeling requirements)

**Supplier Management (20% of time):**
- Negotiate contracts (pricing, MOQs, payment terms, exclusivity)
- Quality assurance (COAs, heavy metals testing, microbial testing)
- Inventory planning (forecast demand, coordinate production runs)
- Relationship management (regular check-ins, resolve issues)
- Backup suppliers (reduce risk of stockouts)

**Product Launch (10% of time):**
- Coordinate with marketing on launch plan (positioning, messaging, creative)
- Provide product education (benefits, dosage, science, safety)
- Train customer success team (how to answer product questions)
- Monitor launch performance (sales, reviews, customer feedback)
- Iterate based on feedback (reformulation, packaging changes)

### Skills Required

**Must-have:**
- Supplement formulation (understand ingredients, dosages, interactions)
- Quality assurance (COAs, testing protocols, FDA compliance)
- Supplier relationships (negotiation, quality control, logistics)
- Project management (manage 3-5 products in development simultaneously)
- Regulatory knowledge (FDA, FTC, state regulations for supplements)

**Nice-to-have:**
- Food science or chemistry background (understand formulation science)
- Manufacturing experience (understand production processes)
- Packaging design (work with designers on labels, bottles)
- Cost accounting (understand COGS, margins, pricing)

- **Multi-product buyer rate:** Target 20-30% of customers buy 2+ products
- **Product margin:** Target 70-80% gross margin on new products

**Secondary Metrics:**

- Product success rate: 70%+ of launches hit revenue targets
- Customer satisfaction: 4.5/5 stars on new products
- Repeat purchase rate: 30-40% for new products

**Diagnostic Metrics:**
- Supplier lead times (how long to produce new batch?)
- Quality issue rate (<1% of batches fail testing)
- Stockout rate (<5% of time out of stock)
- Product return rate (<3% for quality issues)

### Decision-Making Authority

**You can decide without approval:**
- Supplier outreach and negotiations (within budget)
- Ingredient sourcing (within quality standards)
- Testing protocols (third-party labs, testing frequency)
- Packaging tweaks (label copy, design refinements)
- Production scheduling (when to order new batches)

**You must get approval for:**
- New product launches (founder approves product roadmap)
- Major formulation changes (change dosage, add/remove ingredients)
- Supplier changes (switch manufacturers or ingredient suppliers)
- Budget increases (>$10K for product development)
- Pricing strategy (founder approves retail price)

### Communication Protocols

**Daily Standup (Async):**
Post by 9am:

- ❌ Can't read COAs (fundamental quality assurance skill)
- ❌ No supplier relationships (need existing network)
- ❌ Doesn't understand FDA regulations (legal risk)
- ❌ No project management skills (product development has many moving parts)

**When using AI:**
- ❌ Can't negotiate with suppliers (requires human relationships)
- ❌ Can't evaluate ingredient quality (requires expertise)
- ❌ Can't ensure regulatory compliance (legal risk)

### Weekly Deliverables

**Role Type:** Full-time (Human or AI-assisted)  
**Compensation:** $70-90K + equity (if human)  
**Critical Success Factor:** Too much data to make decisions on gut feel

### Why This Role is Critical

At $100K+ monthly revenue, you have thousands of customers, hundreds of ad campaigns, and millions of data points. Making decisions on gut feel is expensive. A data analyst finds 15-20% efficiency gains across marketing spend, identifies high-value customer segments, and designs experiments that compound growth.

**Key insight:** A 10% improvement in conversion rate is worth $10K+ per month in additional revenue at $100K/month scale.

**Experiment Design (25% of time):**
- Design A/B tests (sample size, duration, success criteria)
- Analyze test results (statistical significance, confidence intervals)
- Recommend winners (which variation should we implement?)
- Build testing roadmap (prioritize tests by impact potential)
- Document learnings (what did we learn? what should we test next?)

**Ad Hoc Analysis (20% of time):**
- Answer business questions (why did CAC increase? which product has best margin?)
- Investigate anomalies (why did traffic spike? why did conversion rate drop?)
- Competitive analysis (how do our metrics compare to industry benchmarks?)
- Attribution modeling (which touchpoints drive conversions?)
- Opportunity sizing (how big is the market for new product?)

- Documentation quality (all dashboards have clear definitions)
- Self-service adoption (team can answer own questions 70% of time)

### Decision-Making Authority

**You can decide without approval:**
- Dashboard design and metrics definitions
- Experiment design (sample size, duration, success criteria)
- Data analysis methodology (which statistical tests to use)
- Tool selection (Looker vs. Tableau, SQL vs. Python)
- Reporting cadence (daily, weekly, monthly)

**You must get approval for:**
