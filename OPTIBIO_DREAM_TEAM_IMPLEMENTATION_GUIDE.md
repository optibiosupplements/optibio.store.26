## Three Ways to Use These Materials

### Option 1: Hire Human Team

**Best for:** Founders with funding ($150K+ for 6 months of salaries)

**How to use these materials:**

1. **Job Descriptions** - Use agent profiles as job descriptions
   - Copy "Core Responsibilities" section → job posting
   - Copy "Skills Required" section → requirements
   - Copy "Success Metrics" section → expectations
   - Copy "Red Flags to Avoid" section → interview screening

2. **Interview Guide** - Use agent profiles to structure interviews
   - Ask candidates to walk through "Example Day in the Life"
   - Have them explain how they'd handle scenarios from "Core Workflows"
   - Test their understanding of success metrics (can they explain CAC, LTV, NPS?)
   - Check for red flags (agency background only, can't explain metrics, defensive)

3. **Onboarding** - Give new hires their agent profile on Day 1
   - Read full profile (responsibilities, KPIs, authority, tools)
   - Review Team Coordination Playbook (how we work together)
   - Shadow current work for first week
   - Start contributing in Week 2

4. **Performance Management** - Use KPIs from agent profiles
   - Weekly 1-on-1s: Review "Weekly Deliverables" section
   - Monthly reviews: Review "Success Metrics" section
   - Quarterly planning: Review "Core Responsibilities" and adjust

**Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Post jobs, screen candidates
- Week 3-4: Interview finalists, make offers
- Week 5-6: Onboard new hires
- Week 7+: Full team operational

**Budget:**
- Performance Marketing: $80-120K/year ($7-10K/month)
- Customer Success: $50-70K/year ($4-6K/month)
- Content Strategist: $5-8K/month (contract)
- Fractional CFO: $3-5K/month (contract)
- Designer: $70-100K/year ($6-8K/month) - hire in Month 3-4

**Total:** $25-37K/month for full team

---

### Option 2: Build AI Agent Team

**Best for:** Founders with limited budget, technical skills, or solo operators

**How to use these materials:**

1. **AI Agent Instructions** - Use agent profiles as AI instructions
   - Copy entire agent profile → AI agent instruction set
   - Include: Responsibilities, KPIs, decision authority, tools, workflows
   - Add: "You are [Role Name] for OptiBio. Execute tasks based on this profile."

2. **Manus Projects Setup** - Create 5 separate Manus projects (one per role)
   - Project 1: "OptiBio Performance Marketing"
   - Project 2: "OptiBio Conversion Design"
   - Project 3: "OptiBio Customer Success"
   - Project 4: "OptiBio Content Strategy"
   - Project 5: "OptiBio Finance & Analytics"

3. **Master Instructions** - Set each project's master instruction
   - Copy agent profile for that role
   - Add brand context (from OPTIBIO_MASTER_INSTRUCTION.md)
   - Add team coordination protocols (from OPTIBIO_TEAM_COORDINATION_PLAYBOOK.md)

4. **Knowledge Base** - Upload shared files to each project
   - Brand guidelines (colors, fonts, voice)
   - Product information (KSM-66 specs, clinical studies)
   - Strategy documents (pre-order strategy, launch plan)
   - Performance data (weekly reports, metrics dashboards)

5. **Task Assignment** - Create tasks in appropriate project
   - Need ad campaign? → Create task in "OptiBio Performance Marketing" project
   - Need landing page? → Create task in "OptiBio Conversion Design" project
   - Need customer response? → Create task in "OptiBio Customer Success" project

**Timeline:**
- Day 1: Set up 5 Manus projects
- Day 2: Configure master instructions and upload files
- Day 3+: Start assigning tasks

**Budget:**
- Manus subscription: $20-200/month (depending on usage)
- No salaries or contracts needed

**Limitations:**
- AI can't make phone calls (customer interviews, vendor negotiations)
- AI can't access some platforms (may need human to set up accounts)
- AI can't handle true emergencies (safety issues, legal threats)
- AI needs clear instructions (vague tasks = poor results)

---

### Option 3: Hybrid Human + AI Team

**Best for:** Most founders (balance cost, speed, and quality)

**How to use these materials:**

**Hybrid Model 1: Human Leads + AI Execution**

Hire humans for strategic roles, use AI for execution:
- **Human:** Performance Marketing Specialist (strategy, budget decisions)
- **AI:** Ad creative production (10-15 variations per day)
- **Human:** Customer Success Manager (complex issues, phone calls)
- **AI:** Email responses (simple questions, order status)
- **Human:** Fractional CFO (strategic advising, fundraising)
- **AI:** Financial modeling (update spreadsheets, run scenarios)

**Hybrid Model 2: AI Leads + Human Review**

Use AI for most work, human reviews and approves:
- **AI:** Write ad copy (10-15 variations)
- **Human:** Review and select best 3-5 to launch
- **AI:** Design landing page variations
- **Human:** Review and approve before publishing
- **AI:** Respond to customer inquiries
- **Human:** Review responses before sending (or audit sample)

**Hybrid Model 3: Specialized Roles**

Some roles are better for humans, others for AI:

**Better for Humans:**
- Customer Success (empathy, phone calls, complex issues)
- Fractional CFO (strategic advising, fundraising, investor relations)
- Performance Marketing (budget decisions, platform relationships)

**Better for AI:**
- Content Strategist (write ad copy, emails, blog posts at scale)
- Designer (create variations, A/B tests, rapid iteration)
- Analytics (pull data, create dashboards, run reports)

**Implementation:**
1. Start with AI for all roles (test what works)
2. Identify bottlenecks (where is AI struggling?)
3. Hire humans for those specific roles
4. Keep AI for roles where it excels

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Set up AI agents for all 5 roles
- Week 2-4: Test AI performance, identify gaps
- Week 5-8: Hire humans for bottleneck roles
- Week 9+: Hybrid team operational

**Budget:**
- Manus subscription: $20-200/month
- 1-2 human hires: $10-20K/month
- Total: $10-20K/month (vs. $25-37K for full human team)

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Vague Task Instructions

**Problem:** "Create some ads for Facebook"

**Why it fails:** AI doesn't know:
- How many ads? (1? 10? 100?)
- What angle? (scarcity? social proof? benefits?)
- What format? (image? video? carousel?)
- What's the goal? (awareness? conversions? traffic?)

**Solution:** Be specific
- "Create 10 Facebook ad variations (image format, 1080x1080px)"
- "Test 3 angles: scarcity (sold out last batch), social proof (500+ 5-star reviews), benefits (better sleep, less stress)"
- "Goal: Drive pre-orders at <$30 CAC"
- "Include: Headline, body copy, CTA for each variation"

---

### Pitfall 2: No Performance Feedback

**Problem:** AI creates ads, you launch them, but never tell AI which ones won

**Why it fails:** AI can't learn and improve without feedback

**Solution:** Close the loop
- After 3-5 days, tell AI: "Ad #3 and #7 had best performance (CAC $22 and $24)"
- Ask AI: "Analyze why these won. What patterns should we replicate?"
- Next task: "Create 10 new ads based on winning patterns from Ad #3 and #7"

---

### Pitfall 3: Siloed Agents (No Coordination)

**Problem:** Performance Marketing agent wants new creative, but doesn't tell Designer agent

**Why it fails:** Agents can't read each other's minds or access other projects

**Solution:** You are the coordinator
- Performance Marketing agent says: "Need 10 new ad variations by Wednesday"
- You create task in Designer project: "Performance Marketing needs 10 ad variations by Wednesday (scarcity angle)"
- Designer delivers, you tell Performance Marketing: "New creative ready in shared folder"

---

### Pitfall 4: No Brand Consistency

**Problem:** Each agent interprets brand differently (colors, voice, messaging)

**Why it fails:** Inconsistent brand experience confuses customers

**Solution:** Shared brand guidelines
- Upload same brand files to all projects (logo, colors, fonts, voice guide)
- Include brand context in every master instruction
- Review outputs for consistency (does this look/sound like OptiBio?)

---

### Pitfall 5: Ignoring Red Flags

**Problem:** AI recommends something that violates FDA rules or brand values

**Why it fails:** AI doesn't have perfect judgment, especially on legal/ethical issues

**Solution:** Human oversight
- Review AI outputs before publishing (especially health claims, pricing, legal copy)
- Set up approval workflow for sensitive tasks (customer refunds >$100, health claims, PR statements)
- Escalate to founder when uncertain

---

### Pitfall 6: No Metrics Tracking

**Problem:** Running campaigns but not tracking CAC, ROAS, conversion rate

**Why it fails:** Can't optimize what you don't measure

**Solution:** Daily metrics dashboard
- Assign Finance agent: "Create daily metrics dashboard (pre-orders, traffic, CAC, ROAS)"
- Review dashboard every morning
- Share with other agents: "Yesterday's CAC was $35, need to improve"

---

### Pitfall 7: Analysis Paralysis

**Problem:** Spending weeks planning perfect campaign instead of launching

**Why it fails:** You learn more from launching imperfect campaigns than from planning perfect ones

**Solution:** Bias toward action
- Launch ads within 3 days (not 3 weeks)
- Run A/B tests with 80% confidence (not 99%)
- Ship and iterate (done is better than perfect)
