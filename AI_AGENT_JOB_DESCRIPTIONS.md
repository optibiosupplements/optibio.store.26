## Introduction: Hiring AI Agents for E-Commerce Excellence

Traditional job descriptions are written for human employees with assumptions about work hours, collaboration styles, and career growth. **AI agents operate differently**—they execute tasks with precision, require explicit instructions, and excel at repetitive or data-intensive work that humans find tedious.

This document provides **AI-optimized job descriptions** for the critical roles needed to build and maintain a premium e-commerce web store. Each role is structured to maximize AI agent effectiveness through:

1. **Clear Success Criteria:** Measurable outputs rather than vague responsibilities
2. **Explicit Workflows:** Step-by-step processes rather than "figure it out" mandates
3. **Tool Specifications:** Exact software and APIs required for execution
4. **Quality Standards:** Objective benchmarks for deliverable acceptance
5. **Iteration Protocols:** How to handle feedback and revisions
